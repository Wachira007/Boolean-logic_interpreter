Boolean Expression
Boolean Expression is a Python program that allows you to evaluate boolean expressions and set variables with boolean values. The program uses a simple command-line interface, and can handle negation, parentheses, and variables.
Requirements
Boolean Expression requires Python 3 to run. There are no additional dependencies.
Installation
To install Boolean Expression, simply download the source code and save it to your local machine.
Usage
To use Boolean Expression, open a command-line terminal and navigate to the directory where the program is saved. Then, enter the following command:

python boolean_interpreter.py

This will start the program. You can then enter boolean expressions or set variables using the following commands:
•	To enter a boolean expression: simply type the expression and press enter.
•	To set a variable: type "let", followed by the name of the variable, an equals sign, and the boolean expression to set the variable to. For example, "let x = T".
The program will then evaluate the expression or set the variable, and print the result.
You can exit the program at any time by typing "exit" and pressing enter.
